      <description>Some of the works I&amp;rsquo;ve done that are open sourced:&#xA;ImportOverrides Import Overrides is a custom gui that aims to enhance the import pipeline. When importing Textures through a custom asset post processor, you often have to set the texture settings yourself manually through code. If you&amp;rsquo;re aiming to create a visual importer, you would need to write teh GUI yourself. This package provides the GUI by default to TextureImporterSettings and TextureImporterPlatformSettings allowing you to create your own visual + scriptable import pipeline.</description>

      <description>Dani AI is a node based editor to help design and prototype AI in Unity. Each AI designed and built using Dani AI follows a neural network like schema and attempts to treat each agent as an organism with senses that update in realtime.&#xA;Senses provide natural information about the simulated world and hook into decisions, where the agent executes a series of authored actions from the user.&#xA;You can grab it here on the Asset Store.</description>
