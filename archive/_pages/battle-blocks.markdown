## The Game

Battle Blocks Royale is an arena styled local multiplayer game. Each player controls a cube avatar and has to eliminate his/her opponent. Power ups occasionally spawn to provide support for each player and can upgrade weapons and heal health.

The game was primarily built on Windows, however Linux and OS X support will arive soon!

### Development
Development was mainly done by my teammates, since my goal was to introduce component orientated programming and C#. So I mainly took a backseat role and did team management, repository management, and game design. However, the moments where I did need to code, it was mainly integration as majority of the functionalities and features coded by my teammates were decoupled from each other. Although decoupling modules is great, in order to build a game, those features needed to be integrated through some middleware script. This was what I was mainly responsible for, while my peers tried to figure out how to program things with some guidance (laissez-faire at its finest!).
