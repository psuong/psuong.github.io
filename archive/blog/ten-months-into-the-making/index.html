Repurposed Server/Client Gameplay from initialPrefabs on Vimeo.
Around ten months ago, October of 2018, I prototyped a game idea on Google Slides on how I wanted people to play the game, and entered it into Unity&rsquo;s 2D challenge. But, considering we only had 3 months and the game was very quite large for the scope of the challenge, I turned the game into a much larger vision.

                <article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg"><p>So just a bit of background information, Repurposed is a 2D action arena game with heavy card game elements. I think
videos do more justice at the moment instead of me pitching, so here&rsquo;s the actual gameplay video link:</p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/347782662" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/347782662">Repurposed Server/Client Gameplay</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user97280022">initialPrefabs</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Around ten months ago, October of 2018, I prototyped a game idea on Google Slides on how I wanted people to play the
game, and entered it into Unity&rsquo;s 2D challenge. But, considering we only had 3 months and the game was very quite large
for the scope of the challenge, I turned the game into a much larger vision.</p>
<p>And well&hellip;right now I am at a very content point of working on the game into a playable MVP and I&rsquo;d love to describe
the process on what worked in managing a team, a project, and to avoid burnout. Now this is in the context of me
building the game on my free time while primarily doing consulting/freelance work as my primary day job.</p>
<h1 id="sprints-dont-work">Sprints Don&rsquo;t Work</h1>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to go right off the bat, but for my team sprints did not work. A sprint in a development cycle is
getting tasks with common goals done within a specified amount of time (most commonly around 2 weeks of development).</p>
<p>So here are a few things that I have noticed about sprints. Sprinting implies we have to move fast, so the naming
convention can be off putting as it implies that people have to work fast to get tasks done. Of course, we held daily
&ldquo;scrum&rdquo; to ensure we know where the progress is with said tasks, but even then there was that sort of pressure.</p>
<h1 id="what-worked-instead-of-sprints">What worked instead of sprints?</h1>
<p>Instead, I encouraged the person who did the work to estimate how long it takes for <em>them</em> to do said work. Here&rsquo;s the
approach that ended up feeling the most comfortable:</p>
<p>We started off with a basic user story:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>As &lt;whatever role&gt;, I want &lt;some feature&gt; for &lt;x, y, z reasons&gt;.
</code></pre><p>So for example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>As a game designer, I want minute camera shakes, so that each time I flinch from an attack, the attack feels powerful.
</code></pre><p>Alright so we can list some unknowns/dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unknowns
<ul>
<li>How much should the camera shake?</li>
<li>What is the threshold of the damage a player can take before the camera shakes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dependencies
<ul>
<li>Camera</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now this is a basic user story and pretty much you can get the jist of the idea on what we&rsquo;re supposed to implement and why.
Now, on a game design approach, this makes sense! And we can likely map this to our code. Now, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that I
personally prefer doing a &ldquo;data oriented&rdquo; workflow, where data comes first and is mostly separated from logic operating
on said data.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think about this technically. This user story is pretty basic and leaves a lot to the
imagination. Before anyone starts working on a user story like this, I usually delve into the technical details for a
few minutes and ask the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the minimum amount of data I need to get this working?</li>
<li>Where do I get said data?</li>
<li>What do I do with said data?</li>
<li>Where do I put said data?</li>
</ol>
<p>So with that said, the user story can be decomposed like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>I need the:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>a. delta of the health</li>
<li>b. the minimum threshold for the camera shake</li>
<li>c. some noise</li>
<li>d. the position of the camera</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>I can find the</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>a. delta of the health on the player entity</li>
<li>b. the shake threshold component attached to the player</li>
<li>c. noise by generating the random values on in a <code>Random.Next(...)</code> function</li>
<li>d. the cardinal position of the camera associated specifically with the camera</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>I need to check the delta of the health and compare it to the shake threshold on the camera, generate some random
offset and apply it to the camera&rsquo;s position</li>
<li>The only data I need to put back is the positional offset on the camera</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this, we go over specifically the data we need to touch and we can catch what we&rsquo;re missing while we&rsquo;re
planning, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long does the camera shake?</li>
</ul>
<p>It allows us as a team to reason about our data and limit the number of surprises we run into during development.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m all for iterative and collaborative development, but quite a few people have told me that the way I structure
this emphasizes a lot on planning early on, which is &ldquo;anti agile.&rdquo; While I can definitely see that it may be
&ldquo;anti-agile&rdquo;, I think making sure everyone on the team understands the data of the feature, we can hold each other
accountable and keep the standard high.</p>
<h1 id="avoiding-burnout">Avoiding Burnout</h1>
<p>Respect the invidiual who is working on some task! However long it takes is however long it takes. Now in an ideal
scenario that would be gold, but we live in a world of deadlines and making sure we live and get paid.</p>
<p>If a task honestly takes too long, see if you can help your teammate. Rubber duckying and whiteboarding helps with
visualization. But this is where I personally think it gets interesting as you&rsquo;re managing the team.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario, you&rsquo;ve got a looming deadline in about a month (which is not a lot of time when working part
time on a project!). Now most indie game developers would go in a period called &ldquo;crunch,&rdquo; which is a mad dash to the
finish line to get whatever remaining tasks done.</p>
<p>Now this is certainly worth mentioning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crunch is bad!!! By putting your team under crunch, we ultimately encourage a culture where crunch is okay and that
the short term decisions typically end up being the long term ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I found that worked with the team was:</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re definitely running behind, we revisit our backlog and we make <em>hard</em> decisions early. For example, let&rsquo;s say
we had to overhaul a major piece of infratstructure because it is just too cumbersome to work with, and we expect it
will take a few weeks to do. We defer a lot of intended features to some future date.</p>
<p>To meet our PlayNYC (August 10th) deadline, we made our feature lockout date, July 23rd and we deferred tasks to as
late as 2020.</p>
<h1 id="daily-goals">Daily Goals</h1>
<p>So, personally, I always think that exploring and expanding your skills is typically a good idea. I don&rsquo;t think anyone
should be grounded in just 1 thing, because experiencing other things helps us emphasize with each other!</p>
<p>While it is important to go into your day thinking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do which brings the most value for today?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is equally important to consider,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Can I explore anything new so I can experiment and add to my toolbag of utilities?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all have to learn something new and no one is a master at everything, that&rsquo;s a given. By ensuring that we let
ourselves explore, we again can empathize with our team members who is working on a similar topic/issue and help solve
the problem.</p>
<h1 id="some-last-thoughts">Some Last Thoughts</h1>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s really it regarding team management on a more humane perspective. I&rsquo;m nowhere near done finishing my
game and I&rsquo;ve certainly have things to learn about managing a project, but hope this helps and happy game deving!</p>
