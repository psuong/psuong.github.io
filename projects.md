## initialPrefabs
Under initialPrefabs, I've worked on DANI AI and simulation projects in Unity. 
I'll briefly describe them here, as our website still needs to be updated.

* I focus on data oriented design; programming and understanding how data is 
layed out in memory for high performance/optimization of code/systems.

* [DANI AI](https://initialprefabs.wordpress.com) is a node based decision engine 
for making AI in Unity. What makes DANI AI different from other AI tools is that 
DANI AI attempts to model an organism's thought patterns! We observer, decide, 
and enact on the decision given various scenarios.
  
  * With artist Ian Cheng, I developed pathfinding/flocking algorithms alongside
  implementation of dynamic behavioural actions using DANI AI. The project was 
  published and showcased at NYC's [Museum of Modern Arts](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3656).

## [Kitty in the Box Franchise](http://mokuni.com/press/sheet.php?p=Kitty%20in%20the%20Box%20VR#projects) 
The Kitty in the Box franchise are a series of games for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
and HTC Vive, where you train your kitty to leap into boxes!

## [Velcro - Cubeball](https://github.com/psuong/cubeball)

Cubeball is a local multiplayer soccer game which tied for third place at the CUNY 
Hackathon. Cubeball attempts to democratize gaming by having players use their own
phones as a controller! Each player controls a cube avatar and attempts to push the 
ball into the goal. Players texted their inputs to a server to control their avatars.

## [Viacom Dora](https://github.com/psuong/viacom-dora)

Viacom Dora is a 2D point and click scavenger game designed for kids built at Hack BU, 
which won second place in the best Media Hack. Players collect as many items as they can 
within the time limit and are transitioned into a page where they can record themselves 
speak the Spanish equivalent of the item they collected. From there, players can replay 
their own recording and compare it with the actual Spanish word.

## [Battle Blocks Royale](https://bitbucket.org/psuong01/battle-blocks-royale)

Battle Blocks Royale was a project I lead in ACM Gamedev session where I taught beginners 
the basics of game development and architectural design. It is a third person top down arena 
game where you fight other cubes to the death. This game features a delegate and static event 
system in C# to handle many of the features in game (shooting, healing, power ups, UI, etc).

## [Break Bread With Friends](https://bitbucket.org/cyang001/break-bread-with-friends)

Break Bread is a Django application built in the Fall of 2015 in Professor Grossberg's Web Design 
and Application Class. It is an online restaurant POS system in which customers can schedule tables 
at their earliest convenience and restuarants can easily manage all of the reservation requests.

## [P2PBooks](https://github.com/psuong/p2pbooks)

P2PBooks is a semesterly long software engineering project in Professor Jie Wei's class. The project 
walked through the entire software development cycle. The repo contains all of the source code and 
specification reports.
