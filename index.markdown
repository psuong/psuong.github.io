## About Me 

I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science at the City College of New York. Additionally, I'm also working on a startup company called [UGF Studio](http://www.ugfstudio.com), where my aim is to create game development tools to help other game developers/designers spend less time focusing only on development and more time on their design aspect. Additionally I am also the lead game designer and developer of the team, creating our first larger scaled project [Modern Knights](http://www.ugfstudio.com/#!a-knight-in-the-park-sequel/ccnk).

## Less Official Stuff 
Aside from what I'm actively working on and programming, I like to spend my spare time playing and deconstructing games, reading historical fiction, and tinkering with household items to build something.
