## About Me 

I'm currently an upcoming senior/undergrad studying Computer Science at the City College of New York.

Additionally, I've recently co-founded my own company, [initialPrefabs, LLC](http://www.initialprefabs.com), where we create custom game development tools for other game companies to
streamline their game development process. We work closely with how the team operates so we can help each company achieve their products quicker.

## Less Official Stuff 
Aside from what I'm actively working on and programming, I like to spend my spare time playing and deconstructing games, reading historical fiction, and tinkering with household items to build something.
