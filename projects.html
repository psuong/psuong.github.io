        <p class="text-muted">Over the past year, I have made 3 games under my co-founded start-up company,<a href="http://www.ugfstudio.com/"> UGF Studio</a>.<br><b>Debugit</b> is an educational mobile space adventure game developed for Windows Phone. The purpose of the game was to travel through the solar system in order to reach home, but obstacles may hinder your path. Debug code in order to repair your ship's hull or upgrade your ship's hull, damage, and speed.<a href="http://bit.ly/1C1n8Ok"> |Windows Phone 8 Ver|</a></br>
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted">Wanting a more friendlier version of the original <b>Debugit</b> game, <b>Debugit: The Spinoff</b> removes the debugging aspet and offers more customization and multiple ships to select. The UI and game mechanics have been redesigned, but the gameplay is relatively the same. <a href="http://bit.ly/DebugitAndroid">|Android Ver|</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/DebugitTheSpinoff"> |Windows Phone 8 Ver|</a>
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted">The latest game I contributed to was <b>A Knight in the Park</b>. It is a survival web game where the player has to defend themselves from medieval knights who relentlessly attack you. However, glitches may occur simultaneously which forces the player to change the way the play immediately. <a href="http://bit.ly/1zSScEE"> |Play on Web|</a>

        <p class="text-muted">For my final project in my Python class, I bruteforcecd through passwords from Yahoo and Linkedin. Yahoo had no hashed passwords making the file easy to crack, while Linkedin use a SHA-1 one way hash. While it was simply bruteforcing, the goal of the project was to crack the passwords efficiently. This project covers topics such as file I/0, hash tables, and basic cyber security.<br><a href="https://github.com/psuong/pythonpasswordproject" target=blank>Click here to view it on Github.</a></br></p>
