<p>
I am currently an undergraduate going into my 4th year studying Computer Science at the City College of New York. I am
a <strong>game developer</strong> and a <strong>tinkerer</strong> so I'm usually messing around in <strong>Unity</strong> pushing its limits. On my spare time, aside from enjoying a game or two, I enjoy reading historical fiction and watching streams to relax.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I founded my own company <a href="http://www.initialprefabs.com">initialPrefabs</a>, where we create
custom game development tools for other game development companies. We work closely with other companies in order to
achieve	their products quicker.
