I graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in Computer Science and I currently work at Scholastic as a 
Software Engineer. On my spare time, I am a <strong>game developer</strong> and a <strong>tinkerer</strong>, so you'll 
find my public works on Github.

Additionally, I co-founded my own company <a href="http://www.initialprefabs.com">initialPrefabs</a>. We build both 
editor tools to expedite workflow within Unity and ensure high performance with our tools, so you don't have to worry
about extensive optimizations.
