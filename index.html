<p>
I graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in Computer Science and I currently work at Scholastic as a Software Engineer. On my spare time, I am
a <strong>game developer</strong> and a <strong>tinkerer</strong>, so you'll find my public works on Github.</p>

<p>
Additionally, I founded my own company <a href="http://www.initialprefabs.com">initialPrefabs</a>, where we create
custom game development tools for other game development companies. We work closely with other companies in order to
achieve	their products quicker.
