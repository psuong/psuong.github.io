title: How to Manage?

So it's been a long time since I've actually decided to write a blog. I'd say I would keep my portfolio updated
but that hasn't actually happened that often, since I lead a very crazy lifestyle. This post isn't going to be a ***"how
to be a success X,"*** but really some things that I'll highlight that can help you.

### Really, so who am I? ###
So if you know me, you'll know me as the current ACM President of ACM at City College and a 3rd year Computer Science student. But if you're a close friend, then you know that outside of the college, I actively work on my own start up company [UGF Studio](http://bit.ly/ugfstudio_). I won't go through what my start up does, because that's beyond the scope of this blog post.

### Managing your time ###
Let's be honest, it's the ***most important*** and ***obvious*** skill that we'll all breeze over. There are tons of tools to help with time management, such as [Trello](https://trello.com/) or even a [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar). These tools are there to help you, but if you're not actively using them, those tools will "suck."

**"Grab the lowest hanging fruit!"**

This is a common phrase and what it says is that you should be doing the task that's the most immediate and easy to do. You wouldn't go picking up a fruit at the highest point of a tree, it's too much work and resources.

**Don't do everything.**

Do things one at a time, there's no point in multitasking if the work that comes out of it is crap. (Maybe that can apply for schoolwork, but don't push it!) Couple this up with grabbing the lowest hanging fruit. If you do things one at a time, you'll be a bit more organized.

### Learn to take hits ###
There's something called *opportunity costs* and people generally don't think about it all the time. With the semester rolling in, it's easy to say, "I won't have time because of X class." To put that into perspective, there will be x number of people who will drop out of a project. Some for legitimate reasons, some due to time management issues, etc. A project outside of class is something to put on your resume and provides experiences not taught in class. A class teaches students skills focused around a particular subject. Both can be seen as equally important, but I'll say this straight, grades aren't the **most super important factor**. If you're not using what you learned in class, the class would be considered useless useless.

### General Tips ###
So on ACM, especially for gamedev, I made a Slack account and invited partipants into the team. Utilize that often, since that's a community that can provide help. There are certain channels like #general, where you can ask for help about anything. ***Of course, don't spam.*** The Facebook group is also a means of resource. ***Again, don't spam.*** Use that if you're not on our Slack team. Fatigue will come, don't worry about that because it's natural for people to get fatigue.

### How do I do it? ###
Really, what's up there. Nothing really special about this section.

###Cheers,###
