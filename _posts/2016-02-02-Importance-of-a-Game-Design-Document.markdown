title: Importance of a Game Design Document
---

So recently, the only few commits onto my Bitbucket repository is just cleaning out the repository and updating plugins and assets for my Unity Project. With a lot of that out of my way, I was able to work on other stuff that we're equally important.

## So what is a Game Design Document (GDD)?

If you're into game development and you're serious on creating a long term project to either make it sellable or expand your own skills, you'll need a sort of documentation that lays out the foundation of your game and what the reachable state should be within your long term time frame. 

A GDD is not a pitch! You can form your GDD to help develop the pitch of your game, but it's not a pitch! Pitches, whether game, business, or technical related focuses on a specific target audience and is to either get the audience on board with your idea or simply to inform the audience of a particular topic.

## Why develop a GDD?

As I said, a GDD is a document that records the idea and foundation of your game. As such *most* of your ideas will be in that documentation and you as the product owner can record changes in your game mechanics, technical features, or design features.

But, if you already know all of this stuff that should be in your game, why still make a GDD? Well, the option is always there, you don't have to make a GDD if you know everything that should be in your game. The strength of a GDD lies within working in a team.

Teamwork is probably one of the few skills that can be hard to grow and manage. You might be the person who hauls a lot of the work in order to get things done or you might be the person who knows very little and feels intimidated amongst more experienced people. There are plenty of issues working in a team I won't mention, but one issue is **communication**. Often times, if you're working with a team, you'll have to be working asynchronously (not together). So communication is vital in order to work on a team fairly well and make the least headaches for the manager or team leader.

When working with designers and other developers, a GDD can help mitigate the misinterpretation of the owner's idea, ***if*** written ***well***. This makes it easier for everyone on the team to understand the idea and their partipcipation within the project, rather than going back and forth between team members figuring out what each person needs to do or the components needed to build the game.

Plus if there's contract work involved, the less time you spend going back and forth the less money you as the product owner would need to spend per commission of a piece of work (Saves a lot of money for the product owner and a lot of heachaches for the contract worker).

## Documentation Tips

* Make the writing clear! If the GDD is only for the team's use, then make explanations and writing clear enough for everybody on the team. Less back and forth and more understanding of role and work makes misunderstandings less frequent.

* Use examples in your GDD, but don't overuse it. Examples from other games are good to use because if other people on your team knows about the example game, then the game is a tad bit easier for the team to understand. Don't overuse another example, because your game will become a clone of your example game (at least the idea will be).

* Pictures are worth a thousand words. I really don't like that idiom, but sometimes it's true. Through concept art or even low fidelity wireframes, people can understand the feeling and flow the content is trying to create.

So with that in mind, happy game developing!
