      <description>So just a bit of background information, Repurposed is a 2D action arena game with heavy card game elements. I think videos do more justice at the moment instead of me pitching, so here&amp;rsquo;s the actual gameplay video link:
Around ten months ago, October of 2018, I prototyped a game idea on Google Slides on how I wanted people to play the game, and entered it into Unity&amp;rsquo;s 2D challenge. But, considering we only had 3 months and the game was very quite large for the scope of the challenge, I turned the game into a much larger vision.</description>

      <description>So I preferably enjoy working with low level APIs instead of high level APIs. The main reason behind that is the amount of control I have as a developer, especially on creating the functionality I need. So if there is an alternative API which provides a lower level solution than a high level API which does exactly what I need&amp;hellip;
I would still go for the lower level solution, even if I have to recreate the same functionality as the high level API.</description>
