      <description>Dani AI is a node based editor to help design and prototype AI in Unity. Each AI designed and built using Dani AI follows a neural network like schema and attempts to treat each agent as an organism with senses that update in realtime.
Senses provide natural information about the simulated world and hook into decisions, where the agent executes a series of authored actions from the user.
You can grab it here on the Asset Store.</description>

      <description>Reactive Disposal is really just a small layer on top of Unity&amp;rsquo;s Entity Component System to dispose unmanaged memory. This is not the same as a garbage collector as it does not do it automatically - the dispose function must still be called but this reduces the amount of code needed to write the same functionality over and over again.
