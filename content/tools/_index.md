## Dani AI
Dani AI is a customizable node based decision engine for building game AI in a human like way. I 
largely took part in the theory and runtime implementation of the tool which includes:

* Fuzzy Logic Implementation
* Neuron Based Workflow
* Shifting the design paradigm to a Data Oriented Design

You can find the complete details [here](http://initialprefabs.com/dani-ai/).

## Developer Console
The Developer Console is a **minimalistic** Unity tool which allows **any** game to have an *in-game* console. 
This allows any user and game to customize the game's behaviour in **play mode/runtime**. Inspirations 
for this came from games like CSGO and The Elder Scroll/Fallout series.

Features:

* Global Event System
* Relative Object Event System
* Command Line/Unix like Console Inputs
* Customizable UI

This project is very much still a **WIP** but you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/psuong/event-handler).
Tutorials, documentations, and an Asset Store release are coming soon!
