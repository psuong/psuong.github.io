#### Cubeball
Cubeball is a local multiplayer soccer game which tied for third place at the CUNY Hackathon. 
Cubeball attempts to democratize gaming by having players use their own phones as a controller! 
Each player controls a cube avatar and attempts to push the ball into the goal. Players texted 
their inputs to a server to control their avatars.
