I'm a game developer highly interested in 

* low level tech
* graphics programming 
* performance & optimizations
* C, C#, Rust

# My Work

## Decoy Games, LLC
At [Decoy Games](https://www.decoygames.com/), I was a Senior Engineer & Graphics programmer, where I:
* Develop rendering features to achieve a visual target given the concept art
* Introduce archithecture to manage memory efficiently through custom allocators
* Profile and perform project wide analysis for performance degradation
* Created custom tools for the art team to streamline workflow

### For a more detailed explanation of my work at Decoy Games, LLC, see the link [here](post/decoygames)

## InitialPrefabs
I cofounded my own development studio, [initialPrefabs](https://initialprefabs.com), where I 
primarily do:

* Game Development consultation
  * Creating custom solutions to help other studios build their games / products / technical demos
* Create custom tools to aid the game development process

### For a list of games I have worked on via initialPrefabs, see the link [here](post/initialprefabs)

## Thousand Ant
At [Thousand Ant](http://thousandant.com), I was a contract software engineer and technical writer 
where I help clients create demos and write technical scripts for their products and services.

Some clients I have worked with include:

* [Unity Technologies](https://unity3d.com/)
* [Genvid Technologies](https://www.genvidtech.com/)

### For a list of videos and technical demos I have made via Thousand Ant, see the link [here](post/thousand-ant).

# Spare Time

## Personal Projects
* I am currently working on a **Rust** & **Vulkan** based rendering engine, [Geometroid](https://github.com/psuong/geometroid/tree/feature/hlsl-pipeline).
    * HLSL shader pipeline similar to Unity allowing you to write the Vertex and Fragment shader pipeline.
    * A procedural shape library allowing you to construct meshes on the fly and submit for rendering.
* [Minimal vulkan template](https://github.com/psuong/min-vulkan-template) with egui & winit integration in Rust

## Open Source Repos @ InitialPrefabs
* I've worked on some open source tooling for Unity which can be viewed on the [initialPrefab Github](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs) including:
  * [C# Task Extensions](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/InitialPrefabs.TaskExtensions)
  * [UI Document Post Processor & Code Generation](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/UIToolkitPostProcessor)
  * [MSDF Font Atlas Generation & Font Rendering](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/InitialPrefabs.Msdf)
  * [Customizable Texture Importers](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/ImportOverrides)
  * [MiniAudio integration with Unity DOTS](https://github.com/InitialPrefabs/MiniAudio.Unity)
