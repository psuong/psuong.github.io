Over the past couple of months, I was burned out from life events happening and I could not really 
do any kind of open source work in the past few months.

But, I needed to do something somewhat _mechanical_ and _creative_ so I picked up how to read music sheets again. 
I grew up learning how to play woodwind instruments like clarinet/saxophone but dropped it once I hit college. 

I don't have access to woodwind instruments like before, but DAW (digital audio workstations) do exist so, I looked 
into software like:

* [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/)
* [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/)

However, these are paid software and I needed free and open source due to being on a budget. Luckily, I came across 
[LMMS](https://lmms.io/), which fit my needs exactly!

The software itself is intuitive to use. You click on the notes and the duration of the notes you 
want to play. I chose to learn how to read piano sheets and found community contributed soundfont files 
of grand pianos.

Learning how to read piano sheets is not so terribly different from woodwind instruments. You still have the 
bass and treble cleffs, but a wider range of octaves. Learning and recognizing the octaves is probably the 
most difficult part of the process, because I would often confuse the octave I am in. After messing around with 
the software blindly and going through a few weeks of reading the music sheet for 
[Megaman Zero 3: Cannonball](https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/browse/series/MegaMan), I finally got the rendition 
finished!
