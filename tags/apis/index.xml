      <description>So I preferably enjoy working with low level APIs instead of high level APIs. The main reason behind that is the amount of control I have as a developer, especially on creating the functionality I need. So if there is an alternative API which provides a lower level solution than a high level API which does exactly what I need&amp;hellip;
I would still go for the lower level solution, even if I have to recreate the same functionality as the high level API.</description>
