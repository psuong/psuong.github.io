      <description>Dani AI is a node based editor to help design and prototype AI in Unity. Each AI designed and built using Dani AI follows a neural network like schema and attempts to treat each agent as an organism with senses that update in realtime.
Senses provide natural information about the simulated world and hook into decisions, where the agent executes a series of authored actions from the user.
You can grab it here on the Asset Store.</description>
