## End of the Winter Break

The end of the winter break marks my deadline for my MVP for Modern Knights. Now the question is, "Was the MVP met within 1 month?" The answer is yes and no. Yes the MVP was met and I was able to showcase it at Playcrafting NYC Winter Expo, but I only got to showcase it at the later half of the expo. So for the first half or two third of the expo

## The Game's Reception

Surprisingly, the previous demo's version still had good reception do to our own custom AI framework allowing the AI to play dead. The complexity of our AI and challenge each enemy knight posed to the player made some of the players come back and try the game again. (Great news because I found something that worked well amongst players!) Of course with any game, the design aspects will change and in the newest version, I tried to make both the player and the enemy AI have high risks rather than simply just giving the AI a huge health value.

The newest demo was only shown during the second half of the demo, albeit only to a few selected playtesters due to time constraints. Why was it shown so late? During the wee hours before the expo, I was doing a large amount of bugfixes that I could've done earlier but things were delayed (environment, set up, etc).

Among the few playtesters who have seen the game, visually and aesthetically, they loved how it looked. Mechanically, the AI could've been a lot better and I agree with them mainly because I traded in large health for the knights in exchange for them doing more tactics (covering, flanking, shooting arrows). However, the tactics didn't work because the environment wasn't properly set up (a recipe for disaster for my code). So... the knights were simply just damage sponges.

## Post Mortem Evaluation

Well, being one of the only few programmers, it was difficult to get all that code in and bug free. Plus, with that phenomenal amount of work I had to get done, I burned myself out to even want to look at the game's code. 

List of things that could've been different:

* Use [Trello](trello.com) much more effectively! If half the team is effectively using it, then it's not being effectively used.
* Communication is key, but also is asking good questions. Since the team has to work asynchronously, questions such as, "Is this good enough?" or "What do you think?" aren't good questions because I'm not sure what the point of the question is.
* Difference in skill level is okay! No one needs to be the greatest at what s/he does, but rather just be able to learn how to do something and not be under pressure that s/he isn't getting it. That's the point of learning at your own pace and utilizing your skills on a team.

## So what's the come?

Modern Knights is a game I still want to build over the semester and afterwards. There's a great feeling when playtesters try out your game and they're smiling out of either frustration or joy. However, with the semester starting it's time to pace the game's development a bit slower and refine each mechanic out, such as base capturing, the conrols, flow of the game/map, the knight's AI, and especially audio. (Thanks for the info about audio, [Alyssa](http://portfolio.acmenesmusic.com)!)

I'll be at the [NYU Game Center](http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/events/playtest-thursdays/) to continously test out my mechanics and ideas as well as get more immediate feedback. So if you happen to in the Game Center Thursdays, feel free to drop by and playtest! Or if you happen to be in City College, feel free to drop by the Linux Lab on the 7th floor, I'll usually be there working on the game, hanging out with a friend, or doing some coursework to get it out of my way.
