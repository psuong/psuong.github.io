      <description>I graduated from City College of New York with a Bachelors in Science in Computer Science. I am an avid game developer highly interested in
 Optimizations and high performance computing Game AI Computer Graphics  I&amp;rsquo;ve built a bunch of small workflow tools within Unity and are opened source on Github. Feel free to take a look at various tools I built here.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a number of projects over the years and I definitely need to spruce out this page or split it up in the future, but here are a few projects which meant the most to me:
Reactive Disposal Reactive Disposal is a small micro framework to help manage unmanaged memory. Even though I work in C#, I often use a lot of unmanaged/unsafe memory, meaning I have to release every single one of them.</description>

      <description>So just a bit of background information, Repurposed is a 2D action arena game with heavy card game elements. I think videos do more justice at the moment instead of me pitching, so here&amp;rsquo;s the actual gameplay video link:
 Repurposed Server/Client Gameplay from initialPrefabs on Vimeo.
Around ten months ago, October of 2018, I prototyped a game idea on Google Slides on how I wanted people to play the game, and entered it into Unity&amp;rsquo;s 2D challenge.</description>

      <description>So I preferably enjoy working with low level APIs instead of high level APIs. The main reason behind that is the amount of control I have as a developer, especially on creating the functionality I need. So if there is an alternative API which provides a lower level solution than a high level API which does exactly what I need&amp;hellip;
I would still go for the lower level solution, even if I have to recreate the same functionality as the high level API.</description>
