      <title>Starting with Vulkan and Rust</title>
      <link>https://psuong.github.io/archive/blog/vulcan-rust-part-1/</link>

      <guid>https://psuong.github.io/archive/blog/vulcan-rust-part-1/</guid>
      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to learn Rust and Vulkan together. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of it before using C++ and Vulkan, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to start recreating that previous C++ Vulkan Renderer with Rust. So in these series of blog posts - I&amp;rsquo;ll write some public notes on Rust and how it is interfaced with the Vulkan ash crate.&#xA;The implementation of Vulkan will primarily be based on this tutorial. This blog post will cover the Instance section of the tutorial series.</description>

      <title>UGUIDots Progress Report</title>

      <description>UGUIDOTS is a data oriented workflow of Unity default runtime UI, UGUI. This provides a conversion workflow to convert the authored GameObject UI to a more DOTS friendly UI system, that works with their Universal Render Pipeline (formerly known as Lightweight Render Pipeline).&#xA;While UIElements certainly scales better and a DOTS version is in the works, I wanted to solve my current issues and have a good understanding of the UI Pipeline.</description>

      <description>Dani AI is a node based editor to help design and prototype AI in Unity. Each AI designed and built using Dani AI follows a neural network like schema and attempts to treat each agent as an organism with senses that update in realtime.&#xA;Senses provide natural information about the simulated world and hook into decisions, where the agent executes a series of authored actions from the user.&#xA;You can grab it here on the Asset Store.</description>

      <description>UGUIDots is an on going project to convert Unity&amp;rsquo;s default UI to a data oriented compliant system. The system is meant to augment on top of Unity&amp;rsquo;s UI.&#xA;Currently, the only features supported are:&#xA;Simple image rendering Text rendering Render orders Static Analysis for batching Button States Button closing Image Effects interfaced with Universal Render Pipeline Shaders Scaling &amp;amp; Anchoring Text support through char pointers Github Link&#xA;Preview </description>

      <title>Ten Months into the Making of Repurposed</title>
      <link>https://psuong.github.io/archive/blog/ten-months-into-the-making/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://psuong.github.io/archive/blog/ten-months-into-the-making/</guid>
      <description>So just a bit of background information, Repurposed is a 2D action arena game with heavy card game elements. I think videos do more justice at the moment instead of me pitching, so here&amp;rsquo;s the actual gameplay video link:&#xA;Around ten months ago, October of 2018, I prototyped a game idea on Google Slides on how I wanted people to play the game, and entered it into Unity&amp;rsquo;s 2D challenge. But, considering we only had 3 months and the game was very quite large for the scope of the challenge, I turned the game into a much larger vision.</description>

      <title>Scaffolding in Development</title>
      <link>https://psuong.github.io/archive/blog/low-level-apis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://psuong.github.io/archive/blog/low-level-apis/</guid>
      <description>So I preferably enjoy working with low level APIs instead of high level APIs. The main reason behind that is the amount of control I have as a developer, especially on creating the functionality I need. So if there is an alternative API which provides a lower level solution than a high level API which does exactly what I need&amp;hellip;&#xA;I would still go for the lower level solution, even if I have to recreate the same functionality as the high level API.</description>
