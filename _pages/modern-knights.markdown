## What is Modern Knights?

> Modern Knights is a third person civilian stealth game, where medieval knights are the ruling factor. Escape the city...but be careful, every life counts!

Originally, it was known as A Knight in the Park, my first Unity project that I worked on 2 years ago found over [here](http://www.kongregate.com/games/ugfstudio/a-knight-in-the-park). The concept
was a silly concept, with knights magically invading the present times with gameplay akin to a simple "zombie survival" game.

The direction is now a stealth game with elements of puzzle. Each decision you make counts, whether it's obvious such as going loud or something minute such as fiddling with the environment.

## Enemies

The enemies are medieval knights that were built using my own custom AI System known as [DANI AI]. I wanted these knights to be human like and while behaviour trees did their job,
I also want to implement a form of "evolutionary AI" where these knights will learn over time.

As such, I modelled these knights' behaviours to be similar to a pack of wolves with "surrounding" and waiting to attack. Their spatial awareness of each other still needs some work
since they have some trouble attacking the player, and they attack at different intervals. This is to make the player feel like they're in a pinch as they're trying to defeat the
knights while being surrounded by only a few versus many.
