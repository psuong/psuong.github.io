### Break Bread With Friends

Break Bread With Friends is a semesterly long project in my Web Design class. The purpose of the class was to create a Minimal Viable Product that could potentially be a scalable business. The product was a reservation system that would allow for restaurant managers and staff to easily secure reservations for customers. Additionally, it allowed customers to easily request a reservation and receive text notifications via Twilio.

Tasks I handle were primarily ORM set up, API integrations, and unit & integration testing. As such you can view the project page [here](https://bitbucket.org/cyang001/break-bread-with-friends).
