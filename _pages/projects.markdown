## [DANI AI](http://www.ugfstudio.com/#!blank/dqmpe)

DANI AI is an artifial intelligence plugin for Unity. The aim is to allow both game developers and designers to construct robust AI and quickly receive visual feedback. Rather than emphasize conditions, which is a common trait in state machines and decision traits, DANI AI emphasizes situations. This emphasis was modelled after the human thought process, as a human will always make an action despite the situation; so why shouldn't an in-game AI do the same?

The project is being actively developed and will be updated.

## [Cacti](https://github.com/s1cyan/Cacti)

Cacti is a web app, which allows users to determine whether friends and colleagues are free during a set time frame. The app is currently being developed using Django 1.9.2 and Materialize Framework. Generally, this project will follow the TDD development cycle.

## [Break Bread With Friends](https://bitbucket.org/cyang001/break-bread-with-friends)

Break Bread With Friends is a semesterly long project in my Web Design class. The purpose of the class was to create a Minimal Viable Product that could potentially be a scalable business. The product was a reservation system that would allow for restaurant managers and staff to easily secure reservations for customers. Additionally, it allowed customers to easily request a reservation and receive text notifications via Twilio.

Tasks I handle were primarily ORM set up, API integrations, unit, and integration testing.

## [P2P Books](https://github.com/psuong/P2PBooks)

P2P Books is a semesterly long project in my Software Engineering class. The project walked through the entire life cycle of software engineering and documentation following IEEE standards. Full spec sheet, design report, and an initial release can be found on the project's Github.
