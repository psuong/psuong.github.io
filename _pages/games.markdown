## Games

### Modern Knights
Modern Knights is currently my latest project I'm working on through UGF Studio. Essentially the game is a sequel to A Knight in the Park, however this project is much more grand. This project marks the first integration of a custom AI Framework my team and I plan to release on the Unity Asset Store.

You can view the full project description [here](/modern-knights).

### Battle Blocks Royale 

Battle Blocks Royale is the first game I decided to use in order to teach beginners in the ACM club component based programming and C#. You can view the full project description [here](/games/battle-blocks-royale).

### A Knight in the Park

A Knight in the Park was a quirky 3D survival shooter game, where the player has to defend himself or herself from medieval knights who relentlessy attack you. However, planned "glitches" may occur simultaneously forcing the player to change the way s/he plays.

You can try it out on the web [here](http://www.kongregate.com/games/UGFStudio/a-knight-in-the-park). Unfortunately, since many browsers have stopped plugin support for Unity Web player, you can only try it on Mozilla Firefox or Opera.

### Debugit: The Spinoff

Debugit: The Spinoff is a clone of the original Debugit game, but more puzzle like than the original. The debugging code section was removed in favor of more ship varieties and a redesigned user interface.

You can view the Android and Windows Phone App [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UGFStudio.DebugitTheSpinoff&hl=en) and [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/debugit-the-spinoff/9wzdncrdsh70).

### Debugit

Debugit is an educational mobile game developed for the Windows Phone. The purpose of the game was to travel through various sections throughout space, while dodging asteroids. As such this game was an infinite runner game. To introduce C# syntax, in order to repair your ship, the player had to debug a small snippet of code and if the player wanted to upgrade the ship, then s/he would modify variables in the Upgrade screen.
